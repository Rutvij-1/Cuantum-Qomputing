- I started watching ["Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Riqjdh2oM)
    - Finished half video which covered :
        - Matrix forms of bits/qbits
        - Matrix form of the 4 unary operators (Flip, Identity, Set 0, Set 1)
        - Matrix form of two new operators
            - CNOT gate, flips target bit only if the control bit is 1
            - Hadamard gate, converts bits to qbits and vice-versa
        - Superposition and tensor product
        - Quantum circuit
        - Unit Circle
        - Deutsch Oracle problem:
        > Given a blackbox containing an unary operator. determine whether it is a contant function or not
        - Simplest problem where a Quantum computer outperforms a classical computer
            - Classical computer requires 2 queries
            - Quantum computer requires only 1 query.
