- Came up with an idea for Phase 3.
  Abstract:
  - Create two programs which implement the coding and decoding of RSA algorithm when provided with the necessary input.
  - Create a third program which tries to break the RSA algorithm when provided with the necessary input using the ```Shor's Algorithm```
