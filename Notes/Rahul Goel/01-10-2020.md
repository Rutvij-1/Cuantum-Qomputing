## Notes - 1<sup>st</sup> October 2020

#### Author - Rahul Goel (2019111034)

- Today I started watching the lectures of the Berkley course on Quantum Computing. (EDX)
- I watched the first two lectures which introduce the double slit experiment on photons and electrons and then the Qubits.
- I learnt a lot about the Hisenberg Uncertainity Principle and how the nature behaves in a way that when we try to find the position of an object, we lose other information. (Explained beautifully in the lecture videos with the help of double slit experiment and by the use of polaroids)
