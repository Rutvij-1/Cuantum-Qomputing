- Grover's Algorithm Studying begins. (I'll go slow because this is the algorithm that I have to completely understand and implement)
- Watched the lecture on Grover's Algorithm from the Berkeley course.
- Kind of understand the motive behind it.
- Don't understand how the black box function changes the phase of the desired bit.
