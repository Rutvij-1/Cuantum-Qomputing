# Notes for 31-10-2020
## Author - Rahul Goel (2019111034)

- Read the Course Notes.
- Rewatched the Implementation part of the lecture.
- From what I read on the qiskit page and the course notes, there are two ways that one can to approach the reflection part of the algorithm using the blackbox.
- One can directly write the blackbox as a unitary matrix that inverts the phase only for the value that we are searching.
- Or one can use the blackbox as it is (that is outputs 1 in case of the the correct value and 0 other times) and put the answer register in the |-> state beforehand to gain it.
- I find the former method more intutive.
