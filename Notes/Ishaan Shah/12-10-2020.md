- I read about Hilbert Spaces and learnt about various different single qubit quantum gates.
- Quantum gates are rigid body transformations in Hilbert space, i.e they preserve the angles between qubits.
- These matrice are called as Unitary Matrices and have the property that their conjugate transpose is the same as their inverse.
