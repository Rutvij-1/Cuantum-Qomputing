- Today I watched a lecture about the Double Slit Experiment given by Dr. Richard Feynman.
- The experiment displays the fundamentally probabilistic nature of Quantum Mechanics.
- The lecture was a good starting point for getting used to the wierd nature of Quantum Mechanics.
- Tomorrow I plan to explore this experiment in a bit more depth by looking at some more complex setups like the Quantum Eraser experiment.
